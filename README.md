Fiatee
I purchased a Fiat 500e and was sad to see the lack of projects for the car and openness like with the Nissan Leaf. My goal was to locate CAN messages on the two CAN buses for simple monitoring such as SOC, estimated range, charging status, and door status. I then wanted to get into remote commands for lock/unlock and climate controls.
